This Greaseymonkey mturk script autofocuses the HIT and gives keyboard inputs for all functions with just four clustered keys - 1, 2, w and e.

These HITs can be done quickly with one hand.

Controls:
press 1 for YES or "1 person"
press 2 for NO or "2 or more people"
press w for "0 people"
press e for "Yes - Submit"


Additional:
Holding down the 2 button will keep selecting "No" until the end, and even until the next HIT, so don't fall asleep with your finger on the "No" key.

You won't accidentally select the "No" in the next frame by just hitting the key once, though, unless you hold the key down for more than a second.

Make sure to disable this script in Greasemonkey when not actively doing the HITs, as it is @included on every page.
